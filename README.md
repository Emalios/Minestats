# Minestats

**Minestats** is a utility mod that lets players track and monitor the contents of any block-based inventory in the world. 
Whether you're automating a factory, managing a storage room, or trying to optimize item production, Minestats gives you real-time statistics about how much each block produces, consumes, or stores.

## Roadmap

Please feel free to suggest content either in an issue in the github or in the dedicated channel in the [discord](https://discord.gg/mbyetvK8Rf).
